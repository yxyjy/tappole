**Tappole** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to bridge the digital divide for the elderly. It facilitates accessible, one-tap video connections between seniors and verified volunteers, ensuring social inclusion through a safe, simplified, and high-contrast interface.

This project was developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP)** to address the technical and usability barriers faced by the aging population in digital communication.
